# RentAware
A supporting repository for my RentAware project.

RentAware is a website and app combination which will help landlords and tenants rate each other on their experiences together. The overall aim of this project is to improve the current state of the rental market by allowing prospective tenants to view their landlords history whilst ensuring landlords recieve the perfect tenants. This project will be completely solely in my spare time with some potential help from friends.
